Для снижения избыточности информации из набора признаков были исключены каналы B3, B7, B8, B9 и B12, а также индекс EVI, поскольку они сильно коррелируют с другими характеристиками и несут ограниченную дополнительную информацию. При отборе признаков предпочтение отдавалось физически интерпретируемым и наиболее информативным характеристикам. В итоговый набор включены спектральные каналы B2, B4, B5, B6, B8A и B11, а также индексы NDVI, NDWI и NDBI, что обеспечивает сбалансированное представление различных типов земного покрова при минимальной избыточности признаков."
